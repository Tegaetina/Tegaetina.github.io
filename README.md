## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

On this Project, the HTML was easy to code but while working on the CSS, I had to go back to create a div for the QR Code image. Doing that made it easy for me to edit and position the image in the right place.

It's a Great start for me and i can't wait to take up the next project.
